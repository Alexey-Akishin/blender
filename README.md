Introduction
------------
This branch contains the changes we made to the [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) game engine for the OceanViz project.
OceanViz is developed

In its current iteration, OceanViz is implemented as a plug-in for the
[Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE)](http://www.ecopath.org/) desktop software, using the embedding capabilities
of the Blenderplayer

The OceanViz project was conceived by professor [Dr. Villy Christensen](http://www.fisheries.ubc.ca/faculty-staff/villy-christensen).

The OceanViz development Blender team consists of [Dalai Felinto](http://www.dalaifelinto.com/),
with past support from [Mike Pan](http://www.mikepan.com/) and a team lead by Stephen Danic
from the MDM program at the Centre for Digital Media in Vancouver.

The EwE development team that supports the OceanViz efforts are Jeroen Steenbeek and Joe Buszowski,
with past support from Sherman Lai and Sundaran Kumar.
